## What is PrepArr?

PrepArr is a lightweight Docker sidecar that fully automates Servarr application initialization and ongoing configuration management. It takes your Servarr stack from a blank PostgreSQL database to a fully working, configured system -- without ever opening a browser or clicking through a setup wizard.

Think of PrepArr as **Infrastructure as Code for your media automation stack**. You define your desired configuration in JSON files, and PrepArr continuously ensures your Servarr instances match that specification.

## The Problem

Setting up a Servarr stack involves a surprising amount of manual work:

- **Database provisioning** -- Creating PostgreSQL databases, users, and permissions for each service
- **Setup wizards** -- Clicking through first-run configuration for every instance
- **Download client configuration** -- Connecting qBittorrent, SABnzbd, or other clients by hand
- **Quality profiles** -- Building quality profiles and custom formats through the UI
- **No version control** -- Configuration lives in databases and XML files with no audit trail
- **Configuration drift** -- Manual changes accumulate, and rebuilds never match the original

## How PrepArr Solves It

You write a JSON configuration file describing your desired state, and PrepArr handles everything:

1. **Creates PostgreSQL databases and users** with the correct permissions
2. **Generates `config.xml`** with API keys and database connection strings
3. **Completes the setup wizard** programmatically
4. **Applies your full configuration** -- root folders, quality profiles, custom formats, download clients, indexers, naming conventions, and more
5. **Watches for changes** and continuously reconciles your running configuration against the desired state

## Supported Services

| Service | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Sonarr** | Full support | All configuration resources managed |
| **Radarr** | Full support | All configuration resources managed |
| **Prowlarr** | Full support | Indexer management and application sync |
| **Bazarr** | Full support | Subtitles, languages, providers, Sonarr/Radarr integration |
| **qBittorrent** | Init support | Initial configuration and category setup |
| **Lidarr** | Coming soon | Planned for a future release |
| **Readarr** | Coming soon | Planned for a future release |

## Requirements

- **PostgreSQL** -- SQLite is not supported. PrepArr automates the entire PostgreSQL setup process.
- **Docker or Kubernetes** -- Works with Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, or any container orchestration platform.
